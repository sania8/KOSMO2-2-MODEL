#KOSMOS-2 Model
Overview
The KOSMOS-2-2 model is a Transformer-based causal language model designed for multimodal understanding of image-text pairs. It was proposed in the paper "Kosmos-2: Grounding Multimodal Large Language Models to the World" by Zhiliang Peng, Wenhui Wang, Li Dong, Yaru Hao, Shaohan Huang, Shuming Ma, and Furu Wei.

Features
Model Architecture: Transformer-based architecture optimized for next-word prediction on multimodal data.
Training Data: Trained on GRIT (Grounded Image-Text) dataset, which includes image-caption pairs with spatial coordinates of objects converted into location tokens.
Data Format: Supports a format resembling "hyperlinks" connecting image regions to text spans in captions.
How to Use
Setup: Open the provided .ipynb file in your Jupyter Notebook environment.
Run: Execute all cells to initialize the model and dependencies.
Input: Upload an image for which you want to generate a description.
Output: Save the generated description from the model's predictions.
Future Plans
An application utilizing the KOSMOS-2-2 model will be released soon to simplify the usage and integration of the model into different applications.

Requirements
Python 3
Jupyter Notebook
PyTorch (or compatible deep learning framework)
GRIT dataset (for training, optional for usage)
